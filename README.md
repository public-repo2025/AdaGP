Fig. 1 can be reproduced by running "python test_noisy_dist.py".

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 can be reproduced by running "python test_rc_sq_w.py". 

Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 can be reproduced by running "python test_knn_k.py".

Fig. 11a can be reproduced by running "python test_rc_n.py". Fig. 11b can be reproduced by running "python test_knn_n.py".
